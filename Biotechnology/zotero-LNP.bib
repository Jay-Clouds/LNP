	abstract = {Sleep loss typically imposes negative effects on animal health. However, humans with a rare genetic mutation in the dec2 gene (dec2P384R) present an exception; these individuals sleep less without the usual effects associated with sleep deprivation. Thus, it has been suggested that the dec2P384R mutation activates compensatory mechanisms that allows these individuals to thrive with less sleep. To test this directly, we used a Drosophila model to study the effects of the dec2P384Rmutation on animal health. Expression of human dec2P384R in fly sleep neurons was sufficient to mimic the short sleep phenotype and, remarkably, dec2P384R mutants lived significantly longer with improved health despite sleeping less. The improved physiological effects were enabled, in part, by enhanced mitochondrial fitness and upregulation of multiple stress response pathways. Moreover, we provide evidence that upregulation of pro-health pathways also contributes to the short sleep phenotype, and this phenomenon may extend to other pro-longevity models.},

	abstract = {Earlier work described a mutation in {DEC}2 also known as {BHLHE}41 (basic helix-loophelix family member e41) as causal in a family of short sleepers, who needed just 6 h sleep per night. We evaluated whether there were other variants of this gene in two well-phenotyped cohorts.Sequencing of the {BHLHE}41 gene, electroencephalographic data, and delta power analysis and functional studies using cell-based luciferase.We identified new variants of the {BHLHE}41 gene in two cohorts who had either acute sleep deprivation (n = 200) or chronic partial sleep deprivation (n = 217). One variant, Y362H, at another location in the same exon occurred in one twin in a dizygotic twin pair and was associated with reduced sleep duration, less recovery sleep following sleep deprivation, and fewer performance lapses during sleep deprivation than the homozygous twin. Both twins had almost identical amounts of non rapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep. This variant reduced the ability of {BHLHE}41 to suppress {CLOCK}/{BMAL}1 and {NPAS}2/{BMAL}1 transactivation in vitro. Another variant in the same exome had no effect on sleep or response to sleep deprivation and no effect on {CLOCK}/{BMAL}1 transactivation. Random mutagenesis identified a number of other variants of {BHLHE}41 that affect its function.There are a number of mutations of {BHLHE}41. Mutations reduce total sleep while maintaining {NREM} sleep and provide resistance to the effects of sleep loss. Mutations that affect sleep also modify the normal inhibition of {BHLHE}41 of {CLOCK}/{BMAL}1 transactivation. Thus, clock mechanisms are likely involved in setting sleep length and the magnitude of sleep homeostasis.},

The receptor for {AAV} ({AAVR}; also named {KIAA}0319L) was recently identified, and the precise characterization of {AAV}–{AAVR} recognition is in immediate demand. Taking advantage of a particle-filtering algorithm, we report here the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the {AAV}2–{AAVR} complex at 2.8 Å resolution. This structure reveals that of the five Ig-like polycystic kidney disease ({PKD}) domains in {AAVR}, {PKD}2 binds directly to the spike region of the {AAV}2 capsid adjacent to the icosahedral three-fold axis. Residues in strands B and E, and the {BC} loop of {AAVR} {PKD}2 interact directly with the {AAV}2 capsid. The interacting residues in the {AAV}2 capsid are mainly in {AAV}-featured variable regions. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at the {AAV}2–{AAVR} interface reduces binding activity and viral infectivity. Our findings provide insights into the biology of {AAV} entry with high-resolution details, providing opportunities for the development of new {AAV} vectors for gene therapy.},

              Sleep is essential for healthy aging, and most people need approximately 8–8-1/2 hours of sleep per night to feel good and to function optimally. We previously reported a proline-to-arginine mutation in {DEC}2 that leads to a life-long decrease in daily sleep need. We found that the expression of an important sleep-relevant gene,
              orexin
              , was increased in the {DEC}2 mutant mice. Further investigation revealed that {DEC}2 is a transcriptional repressor for orexin expression, and that mutant {DEC}2 exerts less repressor activity than {WT}-{DEC}2, resulting in increased orexin expression. This study represents the first step toward understanding the underlying molecular mechanism through which {DEC}2 modulates sleep.
            
          , 
            
              Adequate sleep is essential for physical and mental health. We previously identified a missense mutation in the human
              {DEC}2
              gene (
              {BHLHE}41
              ) leading to the familial natural short sleep behavioral trait. {DEC}2 is a transcription factor regulating the circadian clock in mammals, although its role in sleep regulation has been unclear. Here we report that
              prepro-orexin
              , also known as
              hypocretin
              (
              Hcrt
              ), gene expression is increased in the mouse model expressing the mutant h
              {DEC}2
              transgene (h
              {DEC}2-P384R
              ).
              Prepro-orexin
              encodes a precursor protein of a neuropeptide producing orexin A and B (hcrt1 and hcrt2), which is enriched in the hypothalamus and regulates maintenance of arousal. In cell culture, {DEC}2 suppressed
              prepro-orexin promoter-luc
              (
              ore-luc
              ) expression through
              cis
              -acting E-box elements. The mutant {DEC}2 has less repressor activity than {WT}-{DEC}2, resulting in increased orexin expression. {DEC}2-binding affinity for the
              prepro-orexin
              gene promoter is decreased by the P384R mutation, likely due to weakened interaction with other transcription factors. In vivo, the decreased immobility time of the mutant transgenic mice is attenuated by an orexin receptor antagonist. Our results suggested that {DEC}2 regulates sleep/wake duration, at least in part, by modulating the neuropeptide hormone orexin.},

	abstract = {Messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) has emerged as a new category of therapeutic agent to prevent and treat various diseases. To function in vivo, {mRNA} requires safe, effective and stable delivery systems that protect the nucleic acid from degradation and that allow cellular uptake and {mRNA} release. Lipid nanoparticles have successfully entered the clinic for the delivery of {mRNA}; in particular, lipid nanoparticle–{mRNA} vaccines are now in clinical use against coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19), which marks a milestone for {mRNA} therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss the design of lipid nanoparticles for {mRNA} delivery and examine physiological barriers and possible administration routes for lipid nanoparticle–{mRNA} systems. We then consider key points for the clinical translation of lipid nanoparticle–{mRNA} formulations, including good manufacturing practice, stability, storage and safety, and highlight preclinical and clinical studies of lipid nanoparticle–{mRNA} therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. Finally, we give an outlook to future possibilities and remaining challenges for this promising technology.},

              Humans, like most animals, need their beauty sleep. But the preferred amount and quality of sleep varies between individuals—and some individuals exhibit a heritable, lifetime tendency to sleep less then 6 hours per night.

              ) identified a mutation in humans associated with people who regularly require shorter than usual sleep duration. The mutation is found in the gene encoding a transcriptional repressor, {DEC}2, already implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms. Related mutations introduced into mice and flies similarly resulted in shortened sleep phases.

            Some people are genetically determined to get by with less sleep than other people.

            Sleep deprivation can impair human health and performance. Habitual total sleep time and homeostatic sleep response to sleep deprivation are quantitative traits in humans. Genetic loci for these traits have been identified in model organisms, but none of these potential animal models have a corresponding human genotype and phenotype. We have identified a mutation in a transcriptional repressor ({hDEC}2-P385R) that is associated with a human short sleep phenotype. Activity profiles and sleep recordings of transgenic mice carrying this mutation showed increased vigilance time and less sleep time than control mice in a zeitgeber time– and sleep deprivation–dependent manner. These mice represent a model of human sleep homeostasis that provides an opportunity to probe the effect of sleep on human physical and mental health.},
